# Rename-without-mix-up
Renames files in a episode list based on directory file type and name conventions. Created with NET 6.0. 

first open the program and copy and paste folder directory and hit enter. 

Enter file type i use this to rename tv shows on my plex server so commonly i use .MKV .MP4 .AVI and so on. 

once you declare the file type hit enter 

next it will ask for new name so it goes like this 

"TV SHOW" S0xE0 x being your season number DO NOT ADD YOUR STARTING NUMBER AFTER THE EPISODE 0 thats what the next line is for. 

after doing that hit enter 

next it will ask for starting number normally itl be 1 but i left it to inuput just in case. 
so enter your episode starting number and hit enter 

it will now rename them in order it also shows a log of what it was and what it became. Ive modified it to not mix up files but its best practice to give the log a glance

after that feed it the next directory or quit out. \

Enclosed are screenshots of this program. i left them as default names so you can practice on them :)
